# What is this?

This is my repo for the g2i React assessment. It is a 10 question trivia app. Find the assessment [here](https://gist.github.com/severnsc/e09f4f8742b7dd91af9c422d6f210a57)

# How is this app assessed?

The code and functionality will be assessed on the following criteria:

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Use of industry best practices

# What is provided?

- wireframes
- functional requirement
- API endpoint to fetch trivia data

# What needs developing?

See REQUIREMENTS.md for a basic understanding (was created for me to flesh out requirements)

# What is missing / can be impproved?

- Unfortinately Cypress does not work well with window.fetch. Due to this the cypress tests include wait() calls.
- There is no error handling for the API request. The code and UI should handle network or server error properly.
